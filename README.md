To successfully complete first algorithm, manually labeled data needed. In this project those are : olist_order_reviews_dataset_manual_review_480__.csv and olist_order_reviews_dataset_manual_review.csv

The second algorithm is choosing a right model to find predictors for good or bad reviews in topics of delivery or quality


Hey.csv and hey_again.csv are files generated by algorithms to see coefficients for Logistic regression for an algorithms that pertains to comments about delivery, and the second one is feature importance list
